= LED

`led` is a line editor based around the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline[GNU Readline]
library.  Basically, it is an
https://www.gnu.org/fun/jokes/ed-msg.en.html[`ed` clone]
with Readline usability.

The main use case is when you want to quickly open and make a small change to a file without opening a full-screen editor.  You can quickly jump to a certain line number or pattern and make a change _without leaving your shell/terminal_!

== Use example

Inside `led`, use `h` for help.

Basic use:

----
# Start led to edit a file:
$ led myfile.txt
new file: myfile.txt
: a
   1> hello
: wq
backup: current file does not yet exist...
wrote:  myfile.txt

# Show the file using cat
$ cat myfile.txt
hello

# Re-open file and search for "hello"
$ led myfile.txt /hello
opened: myfile.txt
   1@ hello
# Append "bye"
: a
   2> bye
# Print the file
: n
   1: hello
   2@ bye

# Save and exit
: wq
backup: myfile.txt~
wrote:  myfile.txt
----

Programmer example:

----
$ make
src/main.c:1234:10: fatal error: ‘xyz’ undeclared here

# Jump in to edit the line!
$ led src/main.c 1234

# or
$ led src/main.c /xyz
----

== Installation

Install SWIG.

Install GNU Readline and History support for your system with the development packages.

This is:

* APT package: `libreadline-dev`
* Homebrew:    `readline`
* Anaconda:    `readline`

`led` uses a standard Autotools build.

----
$ git clone git@github.com:j-woz/led.git
$ cd led
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=[PREFIX] ...
$ make
$ make install
----

Use `./configure --help` for help.

=== Non-standard libreadline location

If you have libreadline/libhistory in a non-standard location, such as a from-source installation or an Anaconda environment, use something like:

==== Anaconda

This pattern works for Linux or Mac.

----
$ C=$HOME/path/to/conda
# or
$ C=$CONDA_PREFIX
$ export CFLAGS="-I$C/include"
$ export LDFLAGS="-L$C/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,$C/lib"
$ export LIBS="-lreadline -lhistory"
$ ./configure --prefix=...
$ make install
----

==== Mac Homebrew

----
$ C=/usr/local/opt/readline
$ export CFLAGS="-I$C/include"
$ export LDFLAGS="-L$C/lib"
$ export LIBS="-lhistory -lreadline"
$ ./configure --prefix=...
$ make install
----

== Usage

=== Key commands

`.`::
Edit file

`a`::
Append text after current line.
Uses Readline.

`c`::
Change line interactively with Readline.

`d`::
Delete line

`e [FILENAME]`::
Edit the given file.
Use . for interactive prompt.
If no filename is given, it reports the current filename.
Re-reads the file.
If there are unsaved changes to the file, `led` reports a warning and does nothing.

`E [FILENAME]`::
Edit the given file like `e` but unconditionally.

`f [FILENAME]`::
Set the current file name.
Uses Readline for filename completion.
If no argument is given, simply print current file name.
If `FILENAME` is `.`, get filename from interactive prompt with Readline completion.
If the file already exists, `led` reports a warning and does nothing.

`F [FILENAME]`::
Set current file name like `f` but unconditionally.  Uses Readline for filename completion.

`i`::
Insert text before current line.
Uses Readline.

`k[X]`::
Set bookmark X.
Can be used to save important places in a file.
`X` must be a single character.
Bookmarks can be listed with `K` or jumped to with `'`.

`k-[X]`::
Unset bookmark `X`.

`K`::
Show all marks.

`n`::
Print lines with line numbers

`p`::
Print lines in raw format.

`r [FILENAME]`::
Read given file, appending after current line.
Uses Readline for filename completion.
Use `FILENAME` `.` for interactive prompt.
If no argument is given, uses current file.

`q`::
Quit.  If there are unsaved changes, `led` reports a warning and does nothing.

`Q`::
Quit unconditionally without saving.

`w [FILENAME]`::
Write file.  If given an argument, writes to that file, and set the current file to that file.

`wq`::
Write and quit.

`x`::
Paste cut buffer

`y`::
Yank (copy) to cut buffer.

`Y`::
Show cut buffer

`/[PATTERN]`::
Search for `PATTERN`.
If `PATTERN` is omitted, repeats last search.

`\[PATTERN]`::
Reverse search.
If `PATTERN` is omitted, repeats last search.

`=`::
Show current line number, filename, and say if file is modified.

`'[X]`::
Jump to mark `X`.

`_`::
Evaluate Tcl code and print result.  Useful examples:
+
----
: _ puts hello
hello
: _ cd ..  # or anywhere
: _ pwd
: _ puts $led::text  #  the text buffer, a list of string
: _ puts $led::cln   #  the current line number
: _ set v [ lindex $led::text 123 ]  #  extract a line of text as a variable
: _ a $v  #  append text (similar to the led command `a`)
: _ i $v  #  insert text (similar to the led command `i`)
----

This could also be used to implement macros and other extension features.

=== Addressing

Key commands can be prefixed with line addresses:
